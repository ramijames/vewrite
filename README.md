# Vewrite

## Introduction

Vewrite is a project management tool for technical writers, teams, and developer relations units.

It currently includes the ability to create and manage:

- Teams and team members
- Clients
- Workflows with customizable states
- Projects which use workflows
- Deliverables which are part of projects

The core concept behind Vewrite is that teams who are managing projects with deliverables should be able to create a workflow that supports them, so that they can quickly create their deliverables. Automated workflows should allow teams to avoid manually pushing deliverable through the process. 

At the end of the day, the goal is to allow writers to be more independent, while increasing visibility for leaders and stakeholders.
